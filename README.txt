1. `git init` -> Powers your folder to be managed by git, and initialises a new empty repository.
    It also creates a .git folder that has all the relevant logic to manage versions of your project.

2. `ls -a`  -> lists all the hidden files.

3. `touch`  -> this will create a new file, just give the file name with extension.

4. `rm -rf` -> to delete a file. -r will delete all the internal files recursively.
